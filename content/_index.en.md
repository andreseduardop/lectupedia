Withdrawn to this solitary place,  
With a few but learned books,  
I live conversing with the dead,  
listening to them with my eyes.

Open always, if not always understood,  
they amend, they enrich my affairs:  
in rhythms of contrapuntal silence,  
awakened, they speak to the dream of life.  

O Don José, for those great souls  
absconded by death, the learnéd  
press avenges time's slanders.  

In irrevocable flight the hour flees;
but it can be counted fortunate
when we better ourselves by reading.[^Johnson]

_(1936, Francisco de Quevedo)_
