&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Withdrawn to this solitary place,  
With a few but learned books,  
I live conversing with the dead,  
listening to them with my eyes.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Open always, if not always understood,  
they amend, they enrich my affairs:  
in rhythms of contrapuntal silence,  
awakened, they speak to the dream of life.  

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O Don José, for those great souls  
absconded by death, the learnéd  
press avenges time's slanders.  

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In irrevocable flight the hour flees;  
but it can be counted fortunate  
when we better ourselves by reading.[^Johnson]

_(1639, Francisco de Quevedo)_
