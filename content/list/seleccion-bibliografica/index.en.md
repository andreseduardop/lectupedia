Escrito por un distinguido grupo de colaboradores internacionales, este libro analiza las transformaciones de los métodos y materiales de lectura a lo largo de los siglos; mostrando que las revoluciones de la lectura generalmente han precedido a las revoluciones del libro. Los autores examinan no solo las innovaciones técnicas que cambiaron los aspectos físicos de los libros y otros textos, sino también las formas de lectura en evolución y el crecimiento y transformación del público lector. Se detalla la historia de la lectura desde la lectura silenciosa en la Grecia antigua a las novedades introducidas por la imprenta, hasta llegar a la revolución electrónica que estamos viviendo.

[**Manguel, Alberto**. 2014. _A History of Reading_. Penguin Books.](https://amzn.to/3bGNsfl)

In [A History of Reading](https://amzn.to/3bGNsfl), Alberto Manguel follows the capricious and exciting labyrinth of the 6,000 years of the written word. It is an entertaining essay on the role of the reader, hitherto largely forgotten in the history of literature, from Sumerian clay tablets to CD-Rom. It is a delicious mixture of classical studies, psychology, history, anecdotes, memoirs, fantasy... based on a history as personal as it is universal, that of reading. It is the history of the human species from the original point of view of Manguel who, like a friend eager to share his knowledge and his enthusiasm, is able to tell it in a simple and pleasant tone. Manguel has consulted hundreds of books in all the world's libraries and has achieved a work that reads like a novel brimming with surprises for all lovers of books and reading. An amazing and fascinating link between the world and the written word.

[**Vallejo, Irene**. 2022. _Papyrus: The Invention of Books in the Ancient World_. Knopf.](https://amzn.to/3I27DRh)

[This book](https://amzn.to/3I27DRh) is an essay on the history of books. A journey through the life of that fascinating device that we invented so that words could travel through space and time. The history of its manufacture, of all the types that we have tested over almost thirty centuries: books of smoke, stone, clay, reeds, silk, leather, trees and, the latest arrivals, plastic and light.

It is also a fabulous collective adventure starring thousands of people who, over time, have made possible and protected books: oral narrators, scribes, illuminators, translators, street vendors, teachers, wise men, spies, rebels, nuns, slaves, adventurers... Ordinary people whose names in many cases history does not record, those book saviors who are the true protagonists of this essay.

[**Wolf, Maryanne**. 2007. _Proust and the Squid : The Story and Science of the Reading Brain_. Harper Collins.](https://amzn.to/3yxecYR)
 
The brain of every new reader has the extraordinary ability to reorganize itself beyond its original abilities to understand written symbols. But how does the brain learn to read? As world-renowned cognitive neuroscientist and reading scholar Maryanne Wolf explains in [this gripping book](https://amzn.to/3yxecYR), we taught our brains to read just a few thousand years ago, and in the process changed the intellectual evolution of our species. There are critical implications for an evolving brain. Just as writing reduced the need for memory, the proliferation of information and the particular requirements of digital culture may short-circuit some of the unique contributions of written language, with potentially profound consequences for our future.

[**Wolf, Maryanne**. 2018. _Reader, Come Home: The Reading Brain in a Digital World_. Harper.](https://amzn.to/3A94PQm)
 
Years ago, Maryanne Wolf’s _Proust and the Squid_ revealed what we know about how the brain learns to read and how reading changes the way we think and feel. Since then, the ways we process written language have changed dramatically with many concerned about both their own changes and that of children. New research on the reading brain chronicles these changes in the brains of children and adults as they learn to read while immersed in a digitally dominated medium.

Drawing deeply on this research, [this book](https://amzn.to/3A94PQm) comprises a series of letters Wolf writes to us—her beloved readers—to describe her concerns and her hopes about what is happening to the reading brain as it unavoidably changes to adapt to digital mediums.
