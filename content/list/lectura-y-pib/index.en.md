"A country’s development depends on its economic growth, and countries that foster high levels of skills in their population will thrive in the long term. The gains in GDP related to skill improvements lead to substantial gains in GDP per capita, which can be used to finance other objectives, such as those found in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals." (Hanushek, 2017) [^Hanushek] 

Continuing with Hanushek's analysis, we have proposed the correlation between reading level and Gross Domestic Product, per capita, in each country.
